# Banking Project üè¶
This is my first project using C++, serving as an introduction to the language. It allows users to create accounts, perform balance inquiries, make deposits and withdrawals, check the status of all accounts, and delete accounts.

## Functionality
* The banking system project provides the following features:

* Account Creation: Users can create new accounts with unique identifiers.

* Balance Inquiry: Users can check the balance of their accounts.

* Deposit: Users can deposit funds into their accounts.

* Withdrawal: Users can withdraw funds from their accounts.

* Account Status: Users can view the status of all existing accounts.

* Account Deletion: Users can delete accounts from the system.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/Ayush-Parab/Banking-System-Project.git
2. Compile and build the project using a C++ compiler of your choice.
3. Run the executable file generated.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to navigate the banking system and perform various operations.

## Future Improvements
Although this banking system project is a beginner's implementation, there are plans for future improvements, including:

* Enhancing error handling and input validation for a more robust user experience.
* Implementing additional security measures, such as password protection or encryption.
* Adding more advanced banking features, such as fund transfers between accounts.
