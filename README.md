# Banking Project üè¶
The first project that I made using C++(actually my first language as well)!!

It is basically a banking system to keep track of accounts that have been made.

### Things that you can do:
1. Make accounts
2. Balance enquiry
3. Deposit
4. Withdraw
5. Check status of all accounts
6. Delete accounts

It is not completely fool-proof yet, but I'll work on it.
I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism.
Thank you!
